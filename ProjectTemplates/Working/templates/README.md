# DataJuggler.BlazorGallery
Blazor Gallery is now working. You can either clone this project from GitHub https://github.com/DataJuggler/BlazorGallery
or using DOT NET CLI dotnet new install DataJuggler.BlazorGallery

I learned this week how to create a Nuget package for a Blazor site. Never again will I have to delete
Weather Forecast and Counter pages.

Instructions to run this project:
Create a SQL Server Database named BlazorGallery
Execute BlazorGalleryDatabase.sql located in the SQL folder of this project.
Execute Insert Admin.sql


BuildCopy
https://github.com/DataJuggler/BuildCopy

BuildCopy will copy the files from a Visual Studio solution to an output folder. In this case, the output folder is ProjectTemplates\Working\Templates.
BuildCopy also allows you to set ignore folders, so I do not copy the .vs, .git, .bin, .obj, .templateconfig and a few others. 

Here is a video showing you how to setup this project, build the data tier for Blazor Gallery, and build your own DataTier.Net projects.
