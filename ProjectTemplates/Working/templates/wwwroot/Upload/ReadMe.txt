For a published site, the Upload folder will need write permissions for the anonymous user
(IUSR) in IIS.

If copying this project using BuildCopy, this file is ignored so you must manually copy it to the Upload folder or the Upload folder does not show up.

This file is only here so the Upload folder is included in the Nuget package.
You can safely remove this file.
