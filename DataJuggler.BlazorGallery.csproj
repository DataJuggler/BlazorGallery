	<PackageReleaseNotes>
		1.3.5
		6.17.2023: Previous publish had the incorrect version number.

		1.3.4
		6.17.2023: Terms of Service Component was not replacing the ParentMainLayout object
		which had the accepted terms of service date.

		1.3.3
		6.17.2023: I added a slide show feature to the FullScreenImageViewer and MainLayout.

		v1.3.2
		6.15.2023: I added a copy direct link button to the FullScreenImageViewer component.

		v1.3.0
		6.7.2023: My first attempt for fixing BlazorGallery to run without EmailVerification didn't work.
		Now this is fixed, and after the user accepts the terms of service, ParentMainLayout.LoggedInUser
		is replaced. This fixes the upload button not showing up.

		v1.2.9
		6.6.2023: I realized when I added Email Verification, I made the app stop working for people
		who did not have Azure Email Service setup and configured. To fix this, I added a new property
		to the Admin table 'EmailVerificationRequired'. This value is set to 0 in Insert Admin.sql unless you
		change it. This allows people to test in Visual Studio without wiring up Email Verification.


		v1.2.7
		6.3.2023: I have finished adding Email verification using Azure Email Service.
		The way I wrote this, if you want to implement Email Verification Required, set an Environment
		Variable named BlazorGalleryEmail to the connection string of your Azure Email Service domain.
		If you don't set this environment variable, you can test in Visual Studio without email verification
		required.

		v1.2.5
		5.31.2023: I have added numerous features including, but not limited to:
		1. View Large Image button on every image. Click to see an almost full screen image
		2. You can now rename folders by double clicking. Hit Enter to Save or Escape to cancel.
		3. I changed the logo and images to a dark theme.
		4. Redid the layout to be position: fixed, so things do not jump around when the Copy URL button is clicked.

		v1.2.0:
		5.27.2023: I added a View Full Screen button to each image and created a FullScreenImageViewer component.
		It is not actually full screen, but in ViewImage mode, only the selected image is shown.
		I also added a field for Image.LikesCount and User.ProfileVisibility. These two fields are not shown
		yet, but i did create a component that prompts a user if they wish to show their profile publicly.
		My plan is to create a public gallery and all images are allocated a certain amount of time on the main screen. The more likes an image
		gets, the longer it gets to stay.  The Nuget package and database scripts have also been updated.

		v1.1.9
		5.17.2023: I added a Terms of Service component and a user must accept thea Terms of Service
		or they are sent to Google.

		5.15.2023: I fixed the Upload issue not showing up in the folder for a Nuget package.
		The issue was resolved by including a file ReadMe.txt in the Upload folder and packing
		the read me file similar to the other two ReadMe.md files.

		This is the first working version of BlazorGallery.  To run this project, create a SQL Server database named
		BlazorGallery, then execute the SQL file BlazorGalleryDatabase.sql. Finally, build a connection string and
		set a user level environment variable named BlazorGalleryConnString holding the connection string a second
		user level environment variable named BlazorGalleryKeyCode, and make up a string for its value.
		BlazorGalleryKeyCode is used to create password hashes when a user signs up.</PackageReleaseNotes>
